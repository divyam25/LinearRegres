Supervised Learning

Here's my Fall 2017 project.
I have performed Data Analytics using the most basic Machine Learning Models ie. Regression (both Polynomial and Logistic)
I have used the two data-sets from the "sklearn" library namely - 
1) Boston housing prices -> Polynomial Regression
2) Iris Plant -> Multiclass Logistic Reression
